# Configuration
On first run, Micboard will open up a configuration page.  This page can also be accessed from the micboard menu and by pressing <kbd>s</kbd> from within Micboard.

Each wireless channel is assigned unique slot. A single channel QLXD receiver would use 1 slot while a ULXD4Q receiver uses 4.  Drag and drop discovered devices into the slot configuration.  Devices can also be manually added.

Production environments often include multiple networks.  For now, Micboard only discovers devices through the primary NIC.  On Mac OS, this would be the NIC on the top of the Service Order.  Devices on other networks may have to be manually added.  Select a device type, input an ip, and select a channel.

Press Save to apply the configuration.

Once in a group, open the group editor by pressing "edit group" in the nav menu.  The group editor can also be opened by pressing <kbd>e</kbd>.

Once the editor is open -

## Background Images
<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="img/tv_imagebg.png"><img width="40%" src="img/smb_folder.png">
</p>

Image and video<sup>[1](#mp4)</sup> backgrounds can be used with Micboard. Files in the `backgrounds` folder of the micboard configuration directory are displayed based on the channel name. With backgrounds enabled, `01 Fatai` will display `fatai.jpg` as a background for the `01 Fatai` slot.



There are a few keyboard shortcuts to control background modes.
* <kbd>g</kbd> - Toggle image backgrounds
* <kbd>v</kbd> - Toggle video backgrounds


The micboard `backgrounds` folder can be shared via a fileserver.  This provides an easy way for teams to update pictures.

## Extended Names
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/extended.png">
</p>

Larger systems benefit from static channel IDs like 'H01' or 'bp14' and user names, like Dave.  It can be difficult to fit both in a field Shure often limits to 8 characters.

Micboard has an optional feature called **Extended Names**.  When set, user-defined names will be displayed instead of names pulled from the receiver.

When the receiver name is changed via WWB, Micboard follows suit and displays the new name.

Press <kbd>n</kbd> to bring up the extended names editor.  Press save once complete.

#### Bulk Name Loader
Names can be imported from spreadsheets and text files with the **Bulk Loader**.
<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" src="img/bulkbox.png">
</p>

1. Open the Extended Names editor with <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>.
2. Paste a list of names into the bulk box.
3. Click **Load Bulk Names** to load names from the imported list.  Make any necessary edits in the extended editor and **Save**.

## Additional Configuration Options

### Local URL
By default, micboard displays the IP address of the machine as the QR code.  For machines with multiple NICs, you can specify a hostname or IP to be shown by setting the `local_url` key in `config.json`

```
  "local_url": "http://micboard.io:9000",
```
